Come up with title

In Henri Cole's "The Roman Baths at NÃ®mes", a public bathhouse provides
the environment for the speaker to reflect, repent and discover himself.
Yet the speaker projects his mental anxieties onto this possibly
imagined bathhouse, creating a claustrophobic, disorienting space. The
first two lines read as follows: "In the hall of mirrors nobody speaks.
/ An ember smolders before hollowed cheeks." The "hall of mirrors" turns
the speaker's gaze back on itself

disorienting for both sight and sound
