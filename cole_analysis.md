In the Hall of Mirrors

In Henri Cole's sonnet "The Roman Baths at Nîmes", a public bathhouse
provides the environment for the speaker to reflect, to repent, and to
discover himself. Yet the speaker projects his mental anxieties onto
this possibly imagined bathhouse, creating an introspective,
disorienting space. The first line reads as follows: "In the hall of
mirrors nobody speaks." The "hall of mirrors" turns the speaker's gaze
back on itself, turning a descriptive act into a reflective one. In a
hall of mirrors, he is constantly reminded of his enclosure: whichever
way he turns, he is met with an image of himself. Yet this hall is at
once claustrophobic and agoraphobic, since mirrors pointing opposite
each other tend towards infinity, duplicating everything in between.
Further, the mirrors in this hallway replace doors and windows in a
regular one, respectively markers of opportunity and the outside world.
Thus, whoever looks in the hall of mirrors is trapped and cut off from
the exterior, left only with the self (or rather, thousands of selves).

If the first line makes it clear that the space confounds the act of
seeing, the second line equally destabilizes the act of hearing: "An
ember smolders before hollowed cheeks." Crucially, the speaker has moved
on to describing other details of the environment, but the sound of the
line remains fixed as "hall of" has given way to "hollowed". This
echoing of sound mirrors the reflection of image discussed above,
literally trapping the speaker in a sense of self. Nor does this echoing
cease. The speaker continues: "Someone empties pockets, loose change and
keys, / into a locker." Here the internal (off-) rhyme is between
"pockets" and "locker", both objects which contain and enclose,
furthering this suffocating sense of introspection. Between this and the
other echo, "hall of" and "hollowed", which both connote a certain
emptiness, the speaker becomes frustrated and disoriented, closing out
the first quatrain with "My god, forgive me." It may be that the
speaker, having sinned, is put into such an introspective
torture-chamber by God to reflect on his wrongdoings, before finding it
intolerable and asking for God's forgiveness. Or, since the "g" in "god"
is lowercase, perhaps "My god" is a secular interjection and the speaker
has instead wronged someone close to him. Either way, the speaker's
guilt becomes intolerable.

This interjection concluding the first stanza marks the first appearance
of a first-person pronoun, and thus the speaker's first acknowledgement
of their own identity. However, without the benefit of prior knowledge,
we are inclined to treat the first three lines as omniscient narration.
This causes us to question the act of perception: is there an act of
seeing that cannot be exposed by the hall of mirrors, which turns the
gaze back on the subject? In other words, what does it mean to see
without being seen? If the narrator is instead invisible, then do they
omit themselves from the hall of mirrors? What else might the narrator
obscure from view over the course of the sonnet? Yet it is not only
visual perception but also auditory perception that falls under
scrutiny. How are the echoes of "hall of/hollowed" and "pockets/locker"
audible if not for speech? Then perhaps, "nobody speaks" is true in a
more literal sense, in that there is speech in the hall of mirrors but
it comes from some disembodied entity. Though the interjection of "My
god, forgive me" may work to somewhat ground and materialize the
identity of the speaker, the beginning of the second quatrain makes it
clear that the act of perception remains under a critical lens: "Some
say love, disclosed, repels what it sees, / yet if I touch the darkness,
it touches me." To "disclose" is to "uncover and expose to view... to
remove a covering from; to reveal, allow to be seen" (*disclose, n.*).
Nothing in this definition suggests that the thing revealed can respond
with its own gaze, yet love "repels what it sees" when it is disclosed.
Somehow, illuminating love not only renders it visible but also makes
the illuminator visible, suggesting that love and the mirrors from the
first line play similar reflective roles. Though the speaker provides
darkness as a counterexample to love repelling its discloser, the
reciprocity created by the mirrors and love continues in the syntax of
the line "yet if I touch the darkness, it touches me." Taken together,
these two lines present a hypothesis which the speaker tests and
rejects. The speaker exhibits a more ambitious, explorative tone rather
than the primarily descriptive one found in the first quatrain. The
result of this exploration, however, is quite puzzling: darkness is
presented as a form of love. If we take the speaker's suggestion and
replace "love" with "darkness" in the previous line, it destabilizes the
very notion of darkness. What does it mean to disclose darkness, to
uncover it and make it visible? Darkness cannot be made visible through
illumination, or it ceases to become darkness. Light is a precondition
for vision so we cannot say that we truly see darkness, but the
speaker's formulation of disclosure in the previous line suggests that
the darkness can see us. Therefore darkness, simultaneously vast and
suffocating, at once eluding illumination yet reflective (of touch if
not sight), echoes the hall of mirrors established in the opening of the
poem. However, this digression does not induce another plea for
forgiveness in the speaker. Rather, it sounds self-assured, measured,
and contained, which are sentiments evoked by the rhyming of "sees/me",
the reciprocal syntax of line 6, and the overall structure of these two
lines as hypothesis and rejection. Perhaps the speaker's
self-assuredness in lines 5-6 results from his plea for forgiveness in
line 4.

Moving past the digression into love and darkness, the speaker returns
to describing the physical environment. This time, it is not disembodied
description but rather one closely linked to his own experience and
physicality. "In the steamroom, inconsolable tears / fall against us. In
the whirlpool, my arms, rowing through little green crests, help to
steer / the body, riding against death." The speaker is more at ease
with the tangible, physical world than he is in the first quatrain as
his body interacts with the environment, taking his confidence from the
abstract realm of love and darkness and applying it to the physical
world of the bathhouse. Yet the physical and the abstract are always
intertwined in this poem, as "inconsolable tears" take the place of
water vapor. Perhaps this metaphor broadens the poem's questions about
perception into questions about agency. Before, love and darkness had
the ability to sense and respond to sight and touch. Here, the
"inconsolable tears" seem to fall of their own accord, without the
prompting of disclosure or touch. In the world of this poem, objects are
thus invested with the agency of subjects and are not merely reflective
or reciprocal. In fact, the water in both the steamroom and the
whirlpool actively reject the semi-passive role of reflection (that is,
that there must first be something to reflect or respond to): the tears
cannot be consoled and the whirlpool moves, creating turbulent "little
green crests" which work to confound narcissistic reflection.

Though these objects might not resemble those in the opening of the poem
in terms of their agency, what remains constant is the instability of
the speaker's identity. The early stages of disembodied observation have
given way to "I", which is bolstered by the communal "us" of the
steamroom. Finding others against which to face the "inconsolable
tears", the speaker's identity seems stable for a moment. But this
moment does not last long: the speaker's arms, "rowing through little
green crests, help to steer / the body, riding against death." Why would
the speaker say "the body" instead of "my body"? It is as if we are
returning to the disembodiment of the first line as the speaker's body
is isolated. But if the instability of the speaker's identity carries
through from the beginning of the poem, so too does the interiority of
the enclosed space through more audible echoes, the assonance between
"crests" and "death" being one. The more striking example is the sound
"in": "**In** the steamroom, **in**consolable tears / fall against us.
**In** the whirlpool..." Nowhere else in the poem do the sounds make it
as explicit that the speaker is enclosed in the bathhouse.

In light of the poem's introspective environment, then, the next
digressive moment, "Yet what harm / is there in us?" makes sense. The
harm is ostensibly in the water of the whirlpool, which threatens to
drown those in it. But if the entire bathhouse reflects those in it,
then the "us" (here universal, transcending the communal) is the party
that is the source of the harm. This question then attempts to make
light of all the anxieties, uncertainties, and guilt of the speaker that
the speaker has been forced to confront due to the reflective
environment. And if this "us" is truly universal, then it is a claim
that regardless of how unsettling and intimidating the process of
self-reflection is, we cannot be harmed by our own interiority. Thus we
reach the concluding lines of the poem: "I swear to you, my friend, /
crossarmed in a bright beach towel, turning round / to see my face in
lamplight, that eye, ear / and tongue, good things, make something sweet
of fear." One way to read this closing is by focusing on the first
emergence of "you." Perhaps the speaker is saying that despite the
disorienting experience of self-reflection which confounds sight and
hearing, the "eye, ear, / and tongue", or the senses and speech of
another person, are ultimately what "make something sweet of fear",
since they mediate the speaker's own senses which have been constantly
put under pressure.

Yet the closing lines still remain unsettling, perhaps because they echo
the rest of the poem so strongly. If the speaker is to be anchored by
his friend, who is "turning round / to see my face in lamplight", one
cannot shake the notion that in the hall of mirrors, this is merely the
speaker turning around to see his own face, making the reassurance an
illusion. Taking the entire poem into consideration, the "lamplight" in
line 13 echoes the "ember" in line 2, the "turning round" in line 12
reproducing the "whirlpool" in line 8. Further, the bathhouse is not
only circular and reflective but perhaps inverted: the rhyme scheme and
pattern of enjambment suggest that the 8/6 line divide traditional to
Italian sonnets has been turned on its head, and the rhythm bolsters
this inversion as well. To elaborate, the first 6 lines are neatly
end-stopped, as four of them end in periods and two in commas at the end
of a logical phrase. However, 5 of the last 8 lines feature enjambed
lines. Crucially, where the *volta* is usually located at the beginning
of line 9, we find the speaker in the middle of a description of the
whirlpool. Sometimes the concluding couplet is marked off from the rest
of poem, but here the transition to line 13 is also run over and in the
middle of one coherent thought. If we are to accept this inverted 6/8
structure instead, we see that the transition from line 6 to line 7
serves as a more viable *volta*, as the speaker returns from the
abstract to the more tangible world of the bathhouse. The rhyme scheme
supports this intuition as well, since it is as follows (I use the same
letter for off-rhymes and hyphens for rhymes which are uncertain):
*aabbbb cdcd\--cc*. Thus the first six lines and the last eight lines
stand independent from each other. Finally, examining the meter of each
line, lines 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 12 all start with a stressed
syllable, quite a systematic and extensive inversion of the iambic
rhythm.

The sonnet is a self-contained form, but the speaker is thoroughly
trapped by this containment, in an environment that disorients him while
forcing him to reflect on himself. The hall of mirrors confounds sight
while the ubiquitous echoes disorient sound. The whirlpool and the
circularity of the friend "turning round" afford little chance for
escape, all while the poem's structure inverts what is traditional,
known, and familiar. Further questions that may illuminate other
dimensions of this poem include what the bursts of color might signify:
the smoldering ember, the "little green crests", and the "bright beach
towel". Also of interest is the juxtaposition between ancient and
modern: the "Roman Baths" in opposition to the "loose change and keys"
and the "bright beach towel". Though this poem certainly represents and
plays with the concept of containment, one thing it makes clear is that
containment, like the hall of mirrors, is not limited, one-dimensional,
or claustrophobic.
