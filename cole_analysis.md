Come up with title

In Henri Cole's "The Roman Baths at NÃ®mes", a public bathhouse provides
the environment for the speaker to reflect, repent and discover himself.
Yet the speaker projects his mental anxieties onto this possibly
imagined bathhouse, creating an introspective, disorienting space. The
first line reads as follows: "In the hall of mirrors nobody speaks." The
"hall of mirrors" turns the speaker's gaze back on itself, turning a
descriptive act into a reflective one. In a hall of mirrors, he is
constantly reminded of his enclosure: whichever way he turns, he is met
with an image of himself. Yet this hall is at once claustrophobic and
agoraphobic, since mirrors pointing opposite each other tend towards
infinity, duplicating everything in between. Further, the mirrors in
this hallway replace doors and windows in a regular one, respectively
markers of opportunity and the outside world. Thus, whoever looks in the
hall of mirrors is trapped and cut off from the exterior, left only with
the self (or rather, thousands of selves).

If the first line makes it clear that the space confounds the act of
seeing, the second line equally destabilizes the act of hearing: "An
ember smolders before hollowed cheeks." Crucially, the speaker has moved
on to describing other details of the environment, but the sound of the
line remains fixed as "hall of" has given way to "hollowed". This
echoing of sound mirrors the reflection of image discussed above,
literally trapping the speaker in a sense of self. Nor does this echoing
cease. The speaker continues: "Someone empties pockets, loose change and
keys, / into a locker." Here the internal (off-) rhyme is between
"pockets" and "locker", both objects which contain and enclose,
furthering this suffocating sense of introspection. Between this and the
other echo, "hall of" and "hollowed", which both connote a certain
emptiness, the speaker becomes frustrated and disoriented, closing out
the first quatrain with "My god, forgive me." It may be that the
speaker, having sinned, is put into such an introspective
torture-chamber by God to reflect on his wrongdoings, before finding it
intolerable and asking for God's forgiveness. Or, since the "g" in "god"
is lowercase, perhaps "My god" is a secular interjection and the speaker
has instead wronged someone close to him. Either way, the speaker's
guilt becomes intolerable.

This interjection concluding the first stanza marks the first appearance
of a first-person pronoun, and thus the speaker's first acknowledgement
of their own identity. However, is the use of the term "speaker"
presumptuous, if indeed it is true that "nobody speaks" in the hall of
mirrors? It may be that the first few lines are merely thoughts that we
have access to, or a sort of narration-without-speech.

Here, bring in the idea of the echoes then transition to below

such self-gaze and self-perception leads to "my god, forgive me" -\> how
can we reconcile this with everything we were talking about below? ie
the instability of identity

talk about the "internal rhyme" echo, then how can there be an echo if
"nobody speaks"

2 possibilities: he is nobody in 2 senses 1) figuratively, unimportant
etc., 2) unstable/groundless identity (more literal) -- questions the
existence/being-ness of the speaker. This is like his body being
nothing.

instability of identity -- talk about irony between "nobody
speaks"/speaker is speaking, which makes the speaker sort of
omniscient/body-less, then moves later to "My/I". Then what is the
reflection of nothing? **Must you be able to see to be seen? This is
directly related to love, disclosed, repels what it sees. Disclosure is
shedding light on something, not necessarily having it look back!!!!!
"Nobody speaks" -- is he nobody?**
