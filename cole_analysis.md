Come up with title

In Henri Cole's sonnet "The Roman Baths at NÃ®mes", a public bathhouse
provides the environment for the speaker to reflect, repent and discover
himself. Yet the speaker projects his mental anxieties onto this
possibly imagined bathhouse, creating an introspective, disorienting
space. The first line reads as follows: "In the hall of mirrors nobody
speaks." The "hall of mirrors" turns the speaker's gaze back on itself,
turning a descriptive act into a reflective one. In a hall of mirrors,
he is constantly reminded of his enclosure: whichever way he turns, he
is met with an image of himself. Yet this hall is at once claustrophobic
and agoraphobic, since mirrors pointing opposite each other tend towards
infinity, duplicating everything in between. Further, the mirrors in
this hallway replace doors and windows in a regular one, respectively
markers of opportunity and the outside world. Thus, whoever looks in the
hall of mirrors is trapped and cut off from the exterior, left only with
the self (or rather, thousands of selves).

If the first line makes it clear that the space confounds the act of
seeing, the second line equally destabilizes the act of hearing: "An
ember smolders before hollowed cheeks." Crucially, the speaker has moved
on to describing other details of the environment, but the sound of the
line remains fixed as "hall of" has given way to "hollowed". This
echoing of sound mirrors the reflection of image discussed above,
literally trapping the speaker in a sense of self. Nor does this echoing
cease. The speaker continues: "Someone empties pockets, loose change and
keys, / into a locker." Here the internal (off-) rhyme is between
"pockets" and "locker", both objects which contain and enclose,
furthering this suffocating sense of introspection. Between this and the
other echo, "hall of" and "hollowed", which both connote a certain
emptiness, the speaker becomes frustrated and disoriented, closing out
the first quatrain with "My god, forgive me." It may be that the
speaker, having sinned, is put into such an introspective
torture-chamber by God to reflect on his wrongdoings, before finding it
intolerable and asking for God's forgiveness. Or, since the "g" in "god"
is lowercase, perhaps "My god" is a secular interjection and the speaker
has instead wronged someone close to him. Either way, the speaker's
guilt becomes intolerable.

This interjection concluding the first stanza marks the first appearance
of a first-person pronoun, and thus the speaker's first acknowledgement
of their own identity. However, without the benefit of prior knowledge,
we are inclined to treat the first three lines as omniscient narration.
This causes us to question the act of perception: is there an act of
seeing that cannot be exposed by the hall of mirrors, which turns the
gaze back on the subject? In other words, what does it mean to see
without being seen? If the narrator instead invisible, then do they omit
themselves from the hall of mirrors? What else might the narrator
obscure from view over the course of the sonnet? Yet it is not only
visual perception but also auditory perception that falls under
scrutiny. How are the echoes of "hall of/hollowed" and "pockets/locker"
audible if not for speech? Then perhaps, "nobody speaks" is true in a
more literal sense, in that there is speech in the hall of mirrors but
it comes from some disembodied entity. Though the interjection of "My
god, forgive me" may work to somewhat ground and materialize the
identity of the speaker, the beginning of the second quatrain makes it
clear that the act of perception remains under a critical lens: "Some
say love, disclosed, repels what it sees, / yet if I touch the darkness,
it touches me." To "disclose" is to "uncover and expose to view... to
remove a covering from; to reveal, allow to be seen" (cite OED). Nothing
in this definition suggests that the thing revealed can respond with its
own gaze, yet love "repels what it sees" when it is disclosed. Somehow,
illuminating love not only renders it visible but also makes the
illuminator visible, suggesting that love and the mirrors from the first
line play similar reflective roles. Though the speaker provides darkness
as a counterexample to love repelling its discloser, the reciprocity
created by the mirrors and love continues in the syntax of the line "yet
if I touch the darkness, it touches me." Taken together, these two lines
present a hypothesis which the speaker tests and rejects. The speaker
exhibits a more ambitious, explorative tone rather than the primarily
descriptive one found in the first quatrain. The result of this
exploration, however, is quite puzzling: darkness is presented as a form
of love. If we take the speaker's suggestion and replace "love" with
"darkness" in the previous line, it destabilizes the very notion of
darkness. What does it mean to disclose darkness, to uncover it and make
it visible? Darkness cannot be made visible through illumination, or it
ceases to become darkness. Light is a precondition for vision so we
cannot say that we truly see darkness, but the speaker's formulation of
disclosure in the previous line suggests that the darkness can see us.
Therefore darkness, simultaneously vast and suffocating, at once eluding
illumination yet reflective (of touch if not sight), echoes the hall of
mirrors established in the opening of the poem. However, this digression
does not induce another plea for forgiveness in the speaker. Rather, it
sounds self-assured, measured, and contained, which are sentiments
evoked by the rhyming of "sees/me", the reciprocal syntax of line 6, and
the overall structure of these two lines as hypothesis and rejection.
Perhaps the speaker's self-assuredness in lines 5-6 results from his
plea for forgiveness in line 4.

Moving past the digression into love and darkness, the speaker returns
to describing the physical environment. This time, it is not disembodied
description but rather one closely linked to his own experience and
physicality. "In the steamroom, inconsolable tears / fall against us. In
the whirlpool, my arms, rowing through little green crests, help to
steer / the body, riding against death." The speaker is more at ease
with the tangible, physical world than he is in the first quatrain as
his body interacts with the environment, taking his confidence from the
abstract realm of love and darkness and applying it to the physical
world of the bathhouse. Yet the physical and the abstract are always
intertwined in this poem, as "inconsolable tears" take the place of
water vapor. Perhaps this metaphor broadens the poem's questions about
perception into questions about agency. Before, love and darkness had
the ability to sense and respond to sight and touch. Here, the
"inconsolable tears" seem to fall of their own accord, without the
prompting of disclosure or touch. In the world of this poem, objects are
thus invested with the agency of subjects and are not merely reflective
or reciprocal. In fact, the water in both the steamroom and the
whirlpool actively reject the semi-passive role of reflection (that is,
that there must first be something to reflect or respond to): the tears
cannot be consoled and the whirlpool moves, creating turbulent "little
green crests" which work to confound narcissistic reflection.

next: transition to talking about instability of identity

"us" and also "the body"

first "us" is communal, second "us" is universal

definitely mention the inverted structure here

the instability doesn't end: "the body"

something about the bursts of color: green crests, beach towel,
smoldering ember

definitely mention the mix of ancient and modern

something about rhythm

inverted structure
